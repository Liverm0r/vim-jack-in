*jack_in.txt* Automatic REPL starting for Vim

INTRODUCTION                                    *jack_in*

Provides a couple of helper commands for "jacking" in to a Clojure REPL by
auto-starting it. Highly inspired by CIDER.el's feature by the same name.

COMMANDS                                        *jack_in-commands*

These run inside the directory vim is currently in. In the future it would be
nice to run relative to the current file.

                                                *jack_in-:Boot*
:Boot [args]           Start boot with CIDER-nrepl and Refactor-nrepl
                       automatically injected. [args] is a list of tasks to
                       run in boot. If not provided, |g:default_boot_task| is
                       used instead.

                                                *jack_in-:Lein* 
:Lein [args]           Start lein with CIDER-nrepl and Refactor-nrepl
                       automatically injected. [args] is a list of tasks to
                       run in lein. If not provided, |g:default_lein_task| is
                       used instead.
